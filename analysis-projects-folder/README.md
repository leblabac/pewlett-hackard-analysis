# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

The purpose of this analysis project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title, and to identify which employees are eligible to to participate in the mentorship program in order to prepare management for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.  The criterion was based on the birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.
